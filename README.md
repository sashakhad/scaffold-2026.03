# Project Scaffold

A clean, modern scaffold for full-stack web applications built with Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

## 🚀 Quick Start

This project uses **Cursor commands** to make everything easy. Just type these commands in the Cursor chat:

| Command        | What it does                                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/setup`       | Installs everything your project needs                                       |
| `/start`       | Launches your app so you can see it in the browser                           |
| `/new-project` | Creates a fresh copy of this template and pushes it to a private GitHub repo |

---

## 📋 Getting Started

### First Time Setup

1. Open this folder in Cursor
2. Open the chat (click the chat icon or press `Cmd+L` / `Ctrl+L`)
3. Type `/setup` and press Enter
4. Wait for everything to install (takes 1-2 minutes)
5. Type `/start` to launch your app
6. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

**That's it!** You should see your app running.

## 🆕 Starting a New Project

Want to create a new project using this template?

1. Type `/new-project` in the chat
2. Enter a name for your project (like `my-cool-app`)
3. Choose whether the private GitHub repo should live under your personal account or an available organization
4. Follow the instructions to open your new project folder in Cursor
5. Run `/setup` in the new project
6. Run `/start` to launch it

`/new-project` creates a local folder and private GitHub repo only. It does not deploy to Vercel.
